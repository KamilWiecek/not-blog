# Kamil Więcek

Complete end-to-end how-tos are what you can find in this repository.

My main goal is to make the lives of Azure DevOps engineers easier. I share solutions so others don’t have to redo work I’ve already done, focusing on useful automations that were hard to build, but are still valuable even with today’s AI tools. 

I created this repository instead of a traditional blog to avoid the extra work that comes with blogging. Creating content directly on GitHub is easier.
